Question
========

Suppose that the following simple linear regression model has been fitted to the 
Taiwan real estate data from topic 05:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln (X_1) + e
$$

where $X_1$ corresponds to distance to the nearest MRT. The following output 
was obtained from Python:

```{python echo=FALSE}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm
from statsmodels.formula.api import ols

re2 = pd.read_csv("taiwan_dataset.csv")

re2['ldist'] = np.log(re2.dist_MRT)
lm_2 = ols('price ~ ldist', data=re2).fit()
print(lm_2.summary())
```

What is the null hypothesis corresponding to the $t$-statistic with value -21.959?

Answerlist
----------
* $H_0:\; \beta_1 = 0$
* $H_0:\; \beta_0 = 0$
* $H_0:\; \hat{\beta}_1 = 0$
* $H_0:\; \hat{\beta}_0 = 0$

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------
* This is correct.
* This corresponds to the test for the intercept in the model, not the coefficient for `ldist`.
* Hypothesis tests are for population parameters, not estimates, which are denoted with a hat symbol.
