The woman claimed that if she was presented with a cup of milk tea, she would be able to distinguish whether milk or tea was added to the cup first. To test, she was given 8 cups of tea, in four of which milk was added first.\nThe data collected was as follows:\nSuppose that Fisher’s Exact Test was applied to assess if there was any association between her guesses and the truth. Under the null hypothesis of Fisher’s Exact Test, what is the probability of observing the table above?",
