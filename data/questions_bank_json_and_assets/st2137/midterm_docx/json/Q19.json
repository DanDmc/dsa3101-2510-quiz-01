(You are not allowed to use rgamma() in this question, but you can use rexp() and runif().)\nThe algorithm we shall use is the rejection algorithm. Here is pseudo-code for how it works:\nGenerate X∼Exp(2/3) and independently, U∼Unif(0,1). To be explicit, the pdf for X is: fX(x)=23exp−2/3x,x>0\nIf U<(2eX3)1/2e−X/3 then set Y=X and return Y. This is the acceptance step.\nOtherwise, return to step 1 and generate a new X and U.\nRepeat steps 1 - 3 until a Y is accepted. This Y will follow the Γ(1.5,1) distribution.\nNote that not all X values will be accepted. The acceptance rate is the number of Y acceptednumber of (X,U) pairs generated\nWrite a function gen_one_Y() that takes no arguments and returns a vector of length two each time it is run: a single Y, and the number of X variables that were needed to get it.\nUse this function to generate 105 random variables from f(y).\nCreate a histogram of the random variables generated, along with the actual pdf.\nWhat is the acceptance rate? In other words, on average how many X variables are generated until a Y is accepted?\nThe correctness of the above algorithm can be proved theoretically. However, suppose you were given a vector of random variables, and you were told they were from a gamma distribution. Assuming you can use qgamma, explain how you can create a plot to assess if this claim is true. Hint: Think about modifying the qq-plots the we learnt about for normality.",
