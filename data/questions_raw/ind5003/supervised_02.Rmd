Solution

Answerlist
----------

* This is for converting transforming numerical variables to have the same scale.
* This is used for:

  * dimension reduction - reducing the number of continuous variables to a smaller subset, that 
    consists of linear combinations of the original ones.
  * removing correlation between numeric variables - this can improve prediction.

* This converts a single column containing the character version of the categorical
  variable into a set of 0/1 columns representing it. ML methods require numeric inputs..
* This is a process whereby only important columns for prediction are retained.
