1.
(50 points) The data le patient_satisfaction.csv is a random sample collected from a
hospitalaboutthesatisfactoryofpatientsaboutthehospital’sservicewhentheyweredischarged.
The data set includes information about patient’s age, the score of illness severity, the anxiety
score, and the status if the patient went through surgery (1) or only had medical treatment (0).
The given le contains columns with names listed below.
Column’s Name Description
Satisfaction satisfaction score about hospital’s service
Age age of abalone (year)
Severity severity score
Surgical.Medical 1 = had surgery; 0 = no surgery
Anxiety anxiety score please run function setwd() in a separate line (if you need it) when importing the data set
into R. use set.seed(310). You get penalty of (-2) points if you don’t have it. the names given in bold below MUST be used in your R code. please report numerical answers to at least three signicant gures if it’s smaller than one
(e.g. 0.0123) and to three decimal places if it’s larger than one (e.g. 2.345).
Part I: Data Exploration (18 points)
Load the le patient_satisfaction.csv into R and name it as data.
1. (2 points) Write code to change the name of the 4th column of data to Surgical.
2. (2 points) Write code to create a table of proportions for column Surgical. Report the
percentage of patients that had surgery.
3. (2 points) Write code to create a histogram with normal density curve overlay-ed for the
sample of satisfaction.
4. (2 points) Write code to create a QQ plot for the sample of satisfaction. Give your com-
ments.
5. (4 points) Write code to create box plots of the satisfaction scores by groups of surgical
status. Give your comments.
6. (6 points) Write code to create a scatter plot of satisfaction score against the age of patients
for which the points are classied by the surgical status: points of patients had surgical is
in red color and points of patients with no surgical is in blue color. Give your comments.

Part II: Linear Model (8 points)
7. (4 points) Fit a linear regression model for the response variable Satisfaction, named as
M, using all input features, Age, Severity, Surgical and Anxiety. Report p-values of
the regressors that are NOT signicant in the model, at signicance level 0.1.
8. (4 points) Two patients, A and B, that have information listed below. Write code to predict
the satisfaction score for both of them. Report the prediction values.
A: Age = 35, Severity = 45, Anxiety = 2.5 , and had no surgical.
B: Age = 60, Severity = 40, Anxiety = 3 , and had surgical.
Part III: KNN (24 points)
9. (2 points) Write R code to create a new column in data, names as S where S has two
categories: Good and Not Good.
S is Good if the satisfaction score in Satisfaction is larger than 70; and S is Not Good if
the satisfaction score in Satisfaction is ≤ 70.
10. (2 points) Write code to create a new data frame, called data.X which has the three
columns Age, Severity and Anxiety after standardization for all patients.
11. (4 points) Write code to randomly split the total patients into two groups: one group has
15 patients (will be the train set) and other group has the rest of patients (will be the test
set).
For the questions below, we consider S as the response variable. We would want to form
KNN classiers using input features Age, Severity and Anxiety which helps to predict
if a patient ranks Good or Not Good when the patient discharges from the hospital.
12. (6 points) Use the train set with three standardized features to form the KNN classiers
where k = 3,5,7,9,11, and accuracy value for each classier is kept in a vector named
accuracy.
13. (2 points) Write code to plot accuracy against k in the question above.
14. (2 points) Using accuracy as the criterion, report the best k found and the accuracy of the
KNN classier with that value of k.
15. (6 points) Use the KNN with the best k found in Question 14 to predict the rank (Good,
Not Good) that patient A listed in Question 8 will evaluates the hospital service.
Hint: you can use the same train set as in Question 12 above. You may standardize the
values for the new patient using the mean and the standard deviation of all the patients in
the data set given.

2.
(10 points) Alena Lee is working for a company where her current salary is $50,000 annually
and the salary is increased 5% every year.
So far, until end of 2024, she has a saving amount of $30,000.
She plans to form a start-up company which will requires an initial amount of $100,000.
1. Dene a function, function.year, which helps to calculate and return the number of years
that Alena Lee could save up enough money if the proportion of annual salary she puts for
savings is xed at 0.2 (20%).
2. Using function function.year dened above, write R codes that help to calculate the
smallest proportion of annual salary that she should save so that she could have enough
money for her start-up at the end of 2029, (5 years counting from start of 2025 to end of
2029).
Note: The proportions of saving salary should be up to 2 decimal places only.
