disease, which is genetically transmitted and has costly treatment with signicant
side eects, which type of error rate (Type I or Type II) should be prioritized for

(10 points) A data set on house selling price in the US was randomly collected. A
model that helps to predict the selling price of a house using other variables is to be tted.
The description of variables in the data set is given below.
Variable Description
price house’s price in thousand US dollars
size house’s size in square feet (sqft)
bedrooms number of bedrooms
garage 1 = with garage; 0 = no garage
Figure 1: Histogram of price (left) and scatter plot of price against size (right)
(a) A histogram of the house’s price and a scatter plot of the house’s price against house’s
size are given in Figure 1. Comment if it is suitable to t a linear regression model
for price?
(b) A linear model, called M, is tted. The summary output of model M is given in
Figure 2 (next page).
Write down the tted equation of model M.
Report the coecient of the variable garage in model M and interpret it.
(c) Comment on the goodness of t of model M.
(d) The information of a new house is given below. Using model M, calculate the pre-
dicted price of this house.
size = 1500 sqft, bedrooms = 3, garage = 1

(70 points) Consider a random sample of 1,000 people. Their health information is
recorded for a study about factors that may aect the diabetes status of people. The data
set is given in the le diabetes-dataset-1k.csv. The table below gives the description
for some variables in this study.
Variable Description
age person’s age (in years)
hypertension 0 = No, 1 = Yes
heart_disease 0 = No, 1 = Yes
bmi the Body Mass Index
HbA1c_level Hemoglobin A1c level (%)
blood_glucose_level blood glucose level (mg/dL)
diabetes 0 = No, 1 = Yes
For the questions below, Load the data set into R and name it as data. Report the nal numerical answer to three signicant gures if its absolute value is
smaller than one (e.g. 0.0123) and to three decimal places if its absolute value is
larger than one (e.g. -2.345).
Part I: Linear Model (8 points)
For this part, there is no need to split the data set given into a train set and a test
set.
1. Write code to t a linear regression model using all the input features, to be named
as LM, for predicting the probability of having diabetes. Is there any insignicant
variable in model LM?
2. Comment on the goodness of t of model LM.
3. State at least two disadvantages of tting a linear model for a binary response.
Part II: Decision Trees (16 points)
All the decision tree models below are using Information Gain for branch split.
4. Run the command set.seed(2904).
Then, write code to randomly split data into two subsets, one set with 800 rows, to
be named as train.set and other set with the rest of rows, to be named as test.set.
