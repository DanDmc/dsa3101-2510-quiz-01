Question
========

Suppose that the following simple linear regression model has been fitted to the 
Taiwan real estate data from topic 05:

$$
Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \ln (X_1) + e
$$

where $X_1$ corresponds to distance to the nearest MRT. Which of the following 
is/are correct interpretations of the fitted equation:
$$
\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \ln (X_1)
$$

Answerlist
----------
* Every one unit increase in distance-to-MRT is associated with an average increase 
  of $\beta$-units in $Y$.
* Every one unit increase in distance-to-MRT is associated with an average increase 
  of $\hat{\beta}$-units in $Y$.
* Every doubling of distance-to-MRT is associated with an average increase of 
  $\ln(2) \times \hat{\beta}$-units in $Y$.
* Every one unit increase in $\ln(X)$ is associated with an average increase of 
  $\hat{\beta}$-units in $Y$.

Solution
========

Suppose that $\hat{Y} = \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \ln(X_1)$. Then if we double 
$X' = 2 X_1$, 

\begin{eqnarray}
\hat{Y}' &=& \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \ln(X') \\ 
&=& \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 \ln(2 X) \\  
&=& \hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}_1 (\ln(2) + \ln(X)) \\  
&=& \hat{\beta}_1 \ln(2) + \hat{Y}
\end{eqnarray}

Answerlist
----------
* False
* False
* True
* True
