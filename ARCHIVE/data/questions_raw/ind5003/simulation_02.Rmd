Question
========

Which of the following statements are true regarding simulation modeling?

Answerlist
----------

* Simulation does not require data.
* Simulation can be used to make predictions.
* Random variables that are used in simulation must follow a Normal distribution.
* Simulation can be used for scenario-planning purposes.
* Simulation relies on the Central Limit Theorem.
* Simulation is used to estimate means.
* Simulation cannot be used to estimate proportions.
* Simulation results are always deterministic and predictable.
* Simulation can be used to analyze systems with complex interactions.
* Simulation often involves the use of random variables to mimic real-world uncertainty.

Answerlist
----------
* This is not true. Real-world data should be used to calibrate the model. False
* Simulation models do not make predictions of random variables. They estimate means. False.
* The random variables do not need to follow a Normal. Think of rolling a die, for instance.
* Yes, this is precisely what they are for.
* True
* True
* Proportions are also means, so simulation models can be used to estimate means.
* Since they rely on random variables, simulation models are neither deterministic nor 
  predictable. False.
* True
* True
