Question
========
In Python, the following commands can be used to initialise the random number
generator. Assess if the following statement is true or false.

Random variables *cannot* be generated in Python without explicitly setting the
seed.

```
from numpy.random import default_rng
rng = default_rng(5003)
```

Answerlist
----------

* True
* False

Solution
========

Answerlist
----------

* The statement is incorrect. We can always jump straight into generation
  without setting the seed; Python will use a function of the timestamp to 
  set the seed.
* Well done! The statement is indeed false. We can always begin generating 
  without setting the seed.
